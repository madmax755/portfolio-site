                <h1>
                    Log Returns vs. Returns
                </h1>
                <p>In the world of finance, comparing asset performance isn't always straightforward. This post
                    dives into the difference between returns and log returns, emphasising the nice mathematical
                    properties of the latter.</p>
                <h2>Simple Returns</h2>
                <p>Raw prices can be misleading when comparing assets. A high-priced stock might appear impressive, but
                    what if it's stagnant? Meanwhile, a lower-priced stock could be experiencing rapid growth. As an
                    investor/trader you do not care what the exact price of an asset is, only where the price is
                    relative to where it where it has been.
                </p>
                <p>Let's denote $p_t$ as the price of an asset at time t. The return ($r_t$) is calculated as:</p>
                <p>$$ r_t = \frac{p_t - p_{t-1}}{p_{t-1}} = \frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}} - 1 $$</p>
                <p>In essence, return is the relative change in price over a given time period. It's worth noting that
                    $r_t > -1$, as prices can't go below zero (<a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52350082">usually</a>)
                <p>
                <p>For example, if $p_{t-1} = 100$ and $p_t = 110$, then $r_t = 0.1$, representing a 10% return.</p>


                <h2>Log Returns</h2>
                <p> Log returns aim to capture the same idea - change instead of price - but calculates it differently.
                </p>
                <p> Log returns are given by: $$ z_t := \log \left(1+r_t \right) = \log \left( \frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}}
                    \right) $$</p>

                <p>Log returns offer several compelling advantages:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Accurate approximation: For small returns, log returns closely approximate raw returns.</li>
                    <li>Simplified compounding: Log returns can be easily summed over time periods.</li>
                    <li>Infinite support: Unlike raw returns, log returns aren't bounded, resulting in greater symmetry.
                    </li>
                    <li>Normality: Assuming log-normally distributed prices, log returns follow a normal distribution.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Let's explore each of these benefits in detail:</p>

                <h3>Approximation of Raw Returns</h3>
                <p>For small values of $ x $, $\log(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \dots \approx x$. This
                    means that for typical daily returns, which are often
                    close to zero, log returns provide a good approximation of raw returns while offering mathematical
                    advantages.</p>

                <h3>Simplified Compounding</h3>
                <p>One of the most elegant properties of log returns is how they simplify the calculation of compounded
                    returns.
                </p>
                <p>Say you want to find the return over a tradiing week with daily returns $ r_0 = 0.01, r_1 = 0.05, r_2
                    = -0.2, r_3 = 0.1, r_4 = 0.12
                    $.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The price at the end of the week ($p_4$) can be calculated using each return: $$ p_4 =
                    (p_0)(1+0.01)(1+0.05)(1-0.2)(1+0.1)(1+0.12) = 1.0452288 p_0$$
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, $$ r_{0:4} = \frac{1.0452288p_0}{p_0} -1 = 0.0452288 $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this we can see the general formula is $$ r_{0:T} = \prod_{t=0}^{T} (1+r_t) -1$$
                </p>

                <p>
                    To get log returns we use the definition:
                    $$ \begin{aligned}
                    z_{0:T} &= \log (1+r_{0:T}) \\[0.5em]
                    &= \log \left( 1 + \prod_{i=0}^{T} (1+r_i) - 1 \right) \\[0.5em]
                    &= \sum_{t=0}^{T} \log(1+r_i)\\[0.5em]
                    & =\sum_{t=1}^T \log \left(\frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}}\right) \\[0.5em]
                    & =\sum_{t=1}^T\left[\log p_t-\log p_{t-1}\right] \\[0.5em]
                    & =\log p_T-\log p_0\\[0.5em]
                    &= \sum_{t=1}^T z_t
                    \end{aligned} $$

                </p>

                <p>This property makes log returns particularly useful when dealing with high-frequency data or long
                    time series, as we can just add the intermediate log returns to get the log returns over the whole
                    period.</p>


                <h3>Infinite Support</h3>
                <p>Raw returns have a lower bound of -1 (100% loss), but no upper bound. Log returns, however,
                    have infinite support in both directions.</p>

                <h3>Symmetry</h3>
                <p>Simple returns are not symmetric. In order to recover from a return of -0.9 you need a return of
                    10.0. Log returns, however, solve this problem. The natural logarithm function accentuates small
                    negative returns while squashing large positive returns. Because of this, the log return for a
                    doubling is
                    the same distance from 0 as the log return from a halving; returns are symmetric. This symmetry is
                    not only helpful for
                    human intuition, but often aligns better with statistical models and risk management techniques.
